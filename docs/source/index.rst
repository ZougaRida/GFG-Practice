  contain the root `toctree` directive.

GFG Practice documentation
==========================

This is my personal repo for solving the :abbr:`DSA (Data Structures and algorithms)`
problems to get good at them. This repo will contain as well a file to show all the
tricks learned to always revise them and keep tracking of them. The division of
problems will use the Tree showing up on the front page of
`NeetCode <https://neetcode.io/>`__, though the main source of problems will be
`GFG <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/>`__, `LeetCode <https://leetcode.com/>`__ and any
other external reference where I did find or stumbled through the problem. each
problem will have its own docstring and the link where it was found.
